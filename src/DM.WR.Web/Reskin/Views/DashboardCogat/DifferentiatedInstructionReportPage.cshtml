Even more than other students, these individuals will often learn more and sustain their efforts longer if the teacher is able to discover and build upon their interests. For example, if a student is interested in baseball, then reading, writing, social studies, and even science projects can be designed that use baseball as a vehicle for teaching other skills. Of course, it is neither possible nor desirable to adapt all learning to suit a students interests, but to the extent that it occurs, it will lead to greater effort, and, at times, to more sophisticated learning.</p>" +
                                       "<p><b>Focus on Working Memory.</b> Attending carefully to the demands placed on working memory can reap even greater benefits for students with less developed reasoning skills than for other individuals. Students with below-average reasoning abilities are commonly required to do more things at one time than they can do. This is both exhausting and frustrating. Learning may be meaningful at first, but it soon degenerates into an anxious search for surface features that suggest a solution.</p>" +
                                       "<p>Since the primary burden on working memory comes from the concepts, images, sound sequences, and sentences the student must hold in mind, the most effective way to improve performance is to reduce the number of things that must be processed simultaneously. Consider, for example, the seemingly simple task of taking notes in class. In order to take good notes, one must be able to write one thing while listening to another. Makinsense of what is heard can require much additional processing. If the speaker is talking about an image, it must also be perceived or imagined. All this must occur more or less simultaneously with the note taker quickly shifting attention among different subtasks. If possible, reduce working-memory burdens by making it unnecessary to hold all of this information in mind at once.</p>" +
                                       "<p>Working-memory burdens can also be reduced by (1) using familiar concepts, (2) makinconcrete analogies, (3) applying skills that are automatic (such as writing or typing) if they must be performed simultaneously, and by (4) offloading items that must be remembered, processed, or performed simultaneously.</p>" +
                                       "<p><b>Scaffold Wisely.</b> Good reasoning involves what some psychologists call <i>selective encoding.</i> Selective encoding means knowing what to attend to and what to ignore when trying to understand a problem. Students who have below-average reasoning abilities often have difficulty identifying where to focus their attention in a learning situation; therefore, they need very specific directions before beginning a task. The use of attention-getting directions can help these students focus on the important aspects of a task, particularly in reading. Teaching them how to formulate questions of their own to guide their reading or check their understanding of materials also helps them become more-effective learners.</p>" +
                                       "<p>Frequently, students who have below-average reasoning abilities do not have the knowledge base or the level of general cognitive skills necessary for structuring and organizing material. They do not know how to make material meaningful or how to judge what is important and relevant to learn and remember. As a result, these students tend not tolearn effectively in unstructured situations. Typically, students with below-average reasoning abilities learn more effectively in structured environments that make fewer demands on their cognitive resources and provide more direct guidance, coaching, and support. Such students also tend to process information slowly and to need a somewhat slower pace of instruction than other students. The majority of these students have poorly developed listening comprehension skills, so they are not likely to learn effectively in highly verbal environments. Instructional strategies that use teacher or peer modeling, concrete representations of abstract concepts, demonstrations, pictures or other types of illustrations, films, videotapes, and hands-on activities are likely to be more effective than exclusively verbal learning strategies. These students need extensive practice to master a skill and frequent review to maintain the skill. Short periods of practice or review two or three times each week are more effective than one long period every two weeks.</p>" +
                                       "<p>A critical issue for instructional programming for these students is the tradeoff between short-term gains and the development of long-term competence. Highly structured environments that remove the information-processing burden from the learner almost invariably result in higher achievement for such students. When offloading processingburdens, however, there is a tendency to dispense with higher-order reasoning processes and retain lower-order memory and skill execution processes. However, by not routinely practicing the higher-order processes of discovering relationships and patterns or systematically breaking down a complex problem into simpler, more soluble parts, the student is left less able to engage in such higher-order thinking on the next occasion. Therefore, to the extent possible, instruction should scaffold lower-order processes and memory burdens and encourage reasoning and meaning-constructing abilities.</p>" +
                                       "<p><b>Encourage Strategic Thinking.</b> Students who struggle to keep up may follow procedures that get them through a task but that are not generally useful. Working alone on tasks that are poorly understood can thereby leave these students less prepared for future learning than they were before attempting the tasks. When practiced, incorrect or ineffective ways of solving problems or performing tasks can often be learned even more readily than correct or more efficient methods. It is critical, therefore, that students with these profiles be carefully monitored during the early phases of skill acquisition to ensure that they understand the procedure or strategy and are applying it correctly.</p>" +
                                       "<p>Since these students have difficulty identifying appropriate situations in which a particular strategy should be used, the teaching of learning strategies is likely to be much more effective if it is done by modeling and demonstration in the context of ongoing learning situations in the classroom. Modeling the skills comes before prompting students to use them for appropriate schoolwork. Reviewing previous instruction that is related to a new learning task, giving students hints about previous experience that is relevant, and prompting them to think about how they are going to accomplish a learning task can help them become more systematic in their approach to learning.</p>" +
                                       "<p>Students whose score profiles are below average are also likely to need frequent prompting to use a strategy in appropriate situations as well as monitoring to check whether they are using the strategy correctly. These students may not realize that they did not understand reading material or an assignment or that they made an error. They need help to develop self-monitoring skills, but until they do, these students willprobably learn more effectively by working with a partner or in a small group of students who use the skills correctly than from working alone. In such settings, the more-able peers can provide the guidance these students need in order to focus on relevant aspects of a task, to keep track of what they are doing, and to avoid making errors and then practicing the errors.</p>" +
                                       "<p><b>When Grouping, Aim for Diversity.</b> Students who have below-average reasoningabilities typically learn more effectively and have higher levels of achievement when given many opportunities to interact with peers who have better-developed reasoning skills. Students with this profile should not be segregated in classes or in groups within classes consisting solely of lower-scoring students. When teaching group members how to interact, legitimize question asking. By encouraging these students to seek explanations, one improves the likelihood that they will do so. Participation in activities of all sorts, however, can occur at many levels. Students who have not yet learned how to participate fully in an activity can learn much by observing, listening, and doing what they can.</p>" },
        { "4, 5, 6", "<p><b>Build on Strength.</b> These students often display high levels of interest and achievement in particular domains. At all ages, but especially in adolescence, students strive to achieve individuality. One route is through recognition of excellence from peers and adults. Although such recognition is commonly attained through nonacademic activities such as sports, music, and other extracurricular activities, teachers should find ways to encourage student’s particular academic accomplishments. Students who have average levels of reasoning ability can be recognized for their high levels of knowledge in particular domains. Sometimes they excel in other ways, such as in leading discussions, presenting reports, creating science projects, writing essays, or assisting other students in learning. Finding and nourishing the islands of excellence in all student’s schoolwork spreads encouragement.</p>" +
                                       "<p><b>Focus on Working Memory.</b> Students with levels of reasoning abilities that are typical for their age frequently must learn at the limits of their working memories, especially when tasks are new or require the simultaneous execution of several processes. Changes in instructional methods that reduce these burdens on working memory can, therefore, have a significant impact on their success in learning. For example, if a task involves comparing two concepts, it will be much easier if both are simultaneously in view. Have students put all the needed information in one place--on a single sheet of paper or a single concept map.</p>" +
                                       "<p>Educators can also reduce working-memory burdens for these students by using familiar concrete concepts rather than unfamiliar abstract symbols. Familiarity is greatest for overlearned concepts and skills. Practice on low-level skills can free working memory for higher-level processing. Self-monitoring skills are especially troublesome for these students, particularly in the primary grades. Offloading monitoring to another individual by having students work in pairs can be especially effective early in the process of acquiring a new skill or strategy.</p>" +
                                       "<p><b>Scaffold Wisely.</b> Students with average levels of reasoning abilities tend to learn more effectively in school environments that are somewhat, but not highly, structured. These students tend to learn best when instruction is moderately paced and when there is frequent monitoring and feedback on their progress. The goal of this instruction is to provide students with enough support in the form of strategies, memory prompts, and task structure to enable them to infer, deduce,connect, and elaborate--in short, understand--for themselves. Highly structured activities that disallow such thinking may succeed in the short run but leave students less able to reason well on the next occasion.</p>" +
                                       "<p><b>Encourage Strategic Thinking.</b> Memory burdens can be reduced and thinking made more systematic if students learn to be more strategic in their thinking. Since they may make errors when carrying out learning strategies, these students need frequent monitoring as they practice a new strategy, so that errors can be corrected. Modeling how to perform a strategy is likely to be more effective than describing it to students. Individuals who have average levels of reasoning abilities will generally need help in developing more effective and sophisticated strategies as learning materials and tasks become more difficult and complex. This help is likely to be most effective if it is given in the context of a realistic learning task, such as a specific reading or mathematical task that is a part of ongoing instruction. Supervised practice in identifying other situations where the use of the strategy is appropriate will also be beneficial.</p>" +
                                       "<p>Students with average levels of reasoning abilities tend to benefit from direct instruction in certain types of study skills such as note taking, outlining, diagramming, planning use of time, and formulating questions to guide the study of new material. These students need help to learn how to break up complex problems into simpler units so that they can work on the complex materials more effectively. They also need assistance in learning how to keep track of their progress in solving complex problems. These planning and self-monitoring processes are often ignored when instruction is structured by the teacher or by a text, as it often must be for such students. Ultimately, however, the goal is to help students become aware of their own strengths and weaknesses and of the effectiveness of different strategies for learning in different contexts. Such knowledge and skills are not acquired unless they are routinely exercised in situations where feedback is provided.</p>" +
                                       "<p><b>When Grouping, Aim for Diversity.</b> Students typically learn how to think in new ways by first enacting new skills externally. Only after much overt practice can a skill be executed internally, that is, cognitively. Many cognitive skills seem to be acquired by first observing other students or adults model an interaction and, then, gradually learning to participate in the same sort of exchanges. Frequently, these exchanges proceed as conversations between a more knowledgeable participant and a less skilled participant. A critical aspect of learning new ways of thinking, then, is the availability of persons who can converse in ways that capture the type of processing one hopes the less skilled participants will eventually internalize. This is unlikely to occur when all group members are at the same level of competence. Diversity of cognitive competence is thus an essential requirement for groups if less skilled students are to learn how to think in more sophisticated ways.</p>" +
                                       "<p>Much more is required than simply gathering students into groups, however diversResearch shows that students of average ability are sometimes overlooked in groups. More-able students learn because they assume the role of teacher. Less-able students profit if they ask questions and receive good explanations. Students in the middle are easily left out of such exchanges. Therefore, it is often helpful to provide structures that ensure greater participation by all students in group activities. For example, one can rotate students through the position of discussion leader or summarizer. Then, at the conclusion of the discussion, provide feedback on things that the student did well and give one suggestion for improvement.</p>" },

By high school, these individuals will have developed a wealth of different ways of coping with learning and problem-solving tasks.

                     "<p><b>Encourage Strategic Thinking.</b> Above-average students benefit from (1) opportunities to use newly acquired skills for difficult learning tasks and problems, (2) instruction that helps them plan their use of different strategies in different contexts, and (3) working with more-able peers, particularly on difficult problems or learning tasks. These students are generally good at recognizing when they need help and at knowing what kind of help they need in order to accomplish a task. Especially when unfamiliar with a domain, these students may need help to focus attention on the most important features of a problem. By early high school, most above-average students find it helpful to acquire more general strategies for focusing attention such as a self-directed search for related concepts in memory or for analogies between material to be learned and more familiar concepts.</p>" +
                     "<p>Above-average students are quick to acquire different learning strategies. In the primary grades, their use of these strategies may be unreflective; but by middle school, they are generally quite capable of actively discovering the effectiveness of different learning and problem-solving strategies. This can be facilitated if teachers model different strategies, encourage students to try them, and help the students keep track of the results. By high school, these individuals will have developed a wealth of different ways of coping with learning and problem-solving tasks.Exposure to alternative strategies--especially if modeled by older students or adults--can help students appreciate the value of different strategies for different persons and problems. It is also helpful if students can learn to be flexible in the classification of their own learning styles; students should expect their preferences to change as they mature.</p>" +
                     "<p><b>When Grouping, Aim for Diversity.</b> Above-average students (stanines 7-8) are generally excellent group participants. Able to help explain concepts to other students, they learn much from group interactions. One factor, however, is whether even more-able members of the group overshadow their contributions. Although this is less of a concern for these students than for students who have average levels of reasoning abilities, it can occur if a student is reticent or if more assertive students dominate the group.</p>" +
                     "<p>Very able students (stanine 9) can benefit from group interactions when they are able to explain difficult concepts to other students, but they learn more when they are also able to participate as learners. This is unlikely to happen with any regularity when such students work only with their age mates in typical classrooms. Students become learners when other members of the group have equal or greater competence. Competence is primarily defined by the student’s level of achievement in a domain. As one acquires higher levels of competence in any field, diversity in the range of perspectives represented in the group becomes more important for the acquisition of critical reasoning abilities than does diversity in ability. Thus, when grouping very able students with other students, try to devise groups in which the very able students will be learners--not just explainers--and in which there will be a diversity of perspectives among participants.</p>" },
        { "9", "<p><b>Build on Strength.</b> Students who reason exceptionally well benefit most from discovery learning and least from highly structured learning environments. Good discovery learning need not be a solitary task. Students learn most in the company of other learners who can model new ways of understanding a problem and challenge them to improve their current understanding.</p>" +
               "<p>The single greatest need of very able students is for academic challenge at a level commensurate with their abilities and achievements. Sometimes this can be accomplished by the careful selection of challenging instructional materials, special projects, or other enrichment activities; but it often requires instruction, particularly in mathematics, at a level several years in advance of that received by age mates.</p>" +
               "<p><b>Focus on Working Memory.</b> When very able students fail at a task, it is usually because they have not yet acquired the knowledge or the skills required by the task. Since such students learn quickly and easily, acquiring conceptual knowledge is almost entirely dependent on having opportunities to learn. Once a skill is even partially learned, these students tend to turn their attention to higher-level cognitive processes. Such students also discover more quickly the value of monitoring their own progress, and they evaluate the effectiveness of different skill-acquisition strategies. When helping such students acquire basic skills, encourage thoughtful and self-regulated learning through suggestions to try different skill-acquisition strategies and to monitor the effectiveness of each. This can be beneficial even for students in the early primary grades.</p>" +
               "<p><b>Scaffold Wisely.</b> Often one of the greatest needs of very able students is for help to develop the confidence to explore challenging environments. Learning to persist in the face of difficulty can be an important motivational issue for them.</p>" +
               "<p><b>Encourage Strategic Thinking.</b> Very able students are generally receptive to activities that allow them to discover how best to deploy their cognitive resources. For students in the early primary grades, this can mean learning not only that there are different ways to attain competence in performing a skill, memorizing poetry, or solving problems but also that learners have the option of discovering which methods work best for them. This helps develop self-monitoring skills that, in turn, enable the students to acquire self-knowledge about the contexts in which different strategies work best for them.</p>" +
               "<p>For older students, emphasize developing thinking dispositions such as reflectiveness, the willingness to shift perspectives and consider alternative opinions and evidence, the ability to separate problems from their contexts, and the ability to entertain increasingly sophisticated theories of what counts as knowledge and evidence.</p>" +
